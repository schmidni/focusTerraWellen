    The energy of water waves is expressed in their motion: in the open sea it is a regular up-and-down motion, in
    increasingly shallow coastal waters the waves build up and break.
</p>
<p>
    We can use the motion of a breaking wave for surfing as various different forces act on the surfboard. If we
    succeed in bringing them into balance, we can keep the board on the water surface and let the wave carry us forward
    while we use our body weight to control the direction and speed of the surfboard.
</p>
<p>
    Wave power plants convert the motion energy of ocean waves into electricity. There are various technical approaches
    to this, but most of them are still being tested.
