    We can focus sunbeams with a magnifying glass to collect their energy in one point – and start a fire. Other types
    of waves can also be used in a targeted way by focusing them on one point.

    In focal therapy for the treatment of prostate cancer, ultrasound waves are directed at the diseased tissue to heat
    and thus destroy it. This is achieved with a lens that concentrates sound waves – in a similar way that a magnifying
    glass concentrates sunlight.

    Radiosurgery also treats tumours with focused waves. Here, individual gamma rays are directed at the tumour, for
    example by a mobile robot arm, from lots of different angles. While the tu-mour is hit by all the rays, the
    surrounding healthy tissue is only exposed to the low doses of individual rays.

    It is a great challenge to focus energy onto a tar-get and at the same time minimise its effect in other areas. This
    is especially true when waves propagate inside a complex structure – such as the human body or the interior of the
    Earth.
