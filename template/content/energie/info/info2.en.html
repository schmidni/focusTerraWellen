    A black shirt looks black because it hardly reflects any light. Instead, it absorbs almost all the light and
    converts it into heat. That is why we get warm in the sun especially fast when we wear black clothes. The shirt gets
    warm because the sunlight causes the atomic particles in the fabric to vibrate.

    Food can be heated in a microwave oven because it contains water, which absorbs the energy of the microwaves. The
    electrically charged water molecules are turned back and forth by the oscil-lations of the waves, causing them to
    rub against each other and generate heat.

    Absorption is also used to reduce the fogging of car windows. A windscreen fogs up when it is colder than the
    surrounding air, causing water droplets to condensate on it. A new type of coat-ing absorbs mainly the infrared
    radiation of sun-light, causing the windscreen to warm up. As the difference in temperature between the air and the
    windscreen is smaller, fewer droplets are formed.
