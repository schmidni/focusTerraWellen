    Light is refracted by optical lenses and focused in one point or dispersed in space. We know this from eyeglass
    lenses that correct a deformation of the eyeball so that an image is focused on the retina. This gives us sharp
    vision.

    The stronger the vision defect to be corrected, the thicker, heavier and more curved the optical lens is. What is
    unattractive for spectacles is a problem for the operation of lighthouses. The physicist A. J. Fresnel therefore
    developed a special lens by reducing it to its most important feature: the curved surface, because only this
    determines how light is refracted. Thus he obtained a narrow, step-like lens that follows the curvature of a
    conventional lens. To capture even more light for use in lighthouses, additional prism-shaped rings can be arranged
    around the lens.

    Metalenses try to be even more efficient with even less material. For this purpose, nanometre-sized units of grooves
    and metallic pillars form a flat surface. These structures deflect light, breaking it down into its colour
    components. In order to obtain white light behind the lens again, the nanostructures delay the passage of each
    colour component differently so that they come together again when they emerge and converge at exactly the right
    angle towards a focal point. Metalenses thus achieve at least as much precision as conventional lenses. But because
    they are extremely thin, they could revolutionise technical devices such as cameras.
