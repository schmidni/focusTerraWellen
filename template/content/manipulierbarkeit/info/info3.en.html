    Stealth technologies make things invisible or harder to detect. The angular, smooth shape of stealth aircraft
    prevents radar waves from being reflected back to the sender; special coatings ‘swallow’ waves; and suitable devices
    cancel reflections with an oppositely oscillating wave – just like noise-cancelling headphones cancel ambient noise.

    For true invisibility, however, light must be directed entirely around an object. Since this path is longer than the
    direct one, the redirected waves would have to be faster in order to arrive behind the object at the same time as
    the direct ones – otherwise visible lighting effects would occur. However, it is impossible to go faster than the
    speed of light, so an invisibility cloak working in full daylight like Harry Potter’s is probably impossible for us
    to create.

    Sound waves in water, however, can travel at different velocities, so an object can be hidden from ultrasonic waves
    under water. A metamaterial surrounds the object and guides the sound waves through its structure so quickly that
    they arrive behind the object at the same time as the waves that have not been diverted.

    A metafoil made of wafer-thin gold structures can conceal a tiny object and make it seem as if it were not there.
    The foil, which coats the object like a skin, manipulates arriving light in such a way that a flat mirror can be
    seen instead of the object.

    Could earthquake waves be manipulated in such a way that their destructive potential is reduced? Experiments show
    that increasingly taller rows of trees (metaforest) mitigate weak surface waves (like those from traffic) or divert
    them into deeper soil layers. This inspired the development of metafoundations in order to absorb vibrations under
    important structures such as nuclear power plants.
