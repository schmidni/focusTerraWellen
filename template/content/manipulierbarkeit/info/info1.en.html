    A straw in a glass of water appears broken and displaced – in a very specific direction. It would be surprising if
    the straw appeared to be broken in the other direction, i.e. ‘negatively’. This case does not exist in nature.
    However, researchers are working on artificial materials (metamaterials) that, due to their structure, manipulate
    waves in such a way that they are refracted in almost all directions – even unnatural and negative ones. In this
    way, it would in principle be possible to guide light around objects and thus make them invisible.

    Metamaterials consist of units (‘building blocks’) of common materials. However, they are arranged in special,
    usually regularly recurring patterns. Due to their components and structure, each unit has its own effect on an
    arriving wave and determines how the wave is refracted, among other things. All units together determine the
    properties of the metamaterial. Since the units are much smaller than the wavelength of the wave to be influenced,
    the metamaterial appears to the wave as a mass with uniform new, unnatural properties.
