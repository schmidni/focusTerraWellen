    We can also use a waveâ€™s travel time to learn about the material through which it has passed. During examinations of
    breast tissue, ultrasound waves are sent through the breast from different angles. Since waves travel faster through
    denser tumour tissue than through surrounding healthy tissue, the different travel times can be combined to form a
    3D image of the inside of the breast, identifying a potential tumour.

    In the same way, earthquake waves can be used to create an image of subsurface structures, since they travel more
    slowly in liquid rock (e.g. in magma) than in solid rock. The more earthquake waves travel through the ground from
    different angles, the more accurate the image. That is why it is important to record as many quakes as possible with
    as many well-distributed measuring stations as possible.

    Even weak seismic waves pick up information about what lies underground. They may be generated by road traffic or
    ocean waves or anything else that causes the ground to vibrate. Since these waves are available almost anytime and
    anywhere, they offer more opportunities to monitor things like volcanoes, dams and bridges.

    We use sound waves to study the oceans and the atmosphere. Since they travel faster through warmer areas than
    through colder ones, their travel times can be used to determine temperature distributions. As these distributions
    have an effect on air and ocean currents, such measurements provide important data for weather and climate models.
