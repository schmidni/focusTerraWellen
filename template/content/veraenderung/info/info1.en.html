    The watermelon looks nice and green on the out-side â€“ but is it ripe? You can find out by knocking on it. This sends
    a sound wave through the melon, causing it to vibrate. The vibration is transmitted to the air and we hear a sound
    that tells us the condition of the pulp. A flat, dull sound means it is not yet firm enough or already mushy; a
    bright and clear sound means the melon is firm and ripe.
