    We shine X-rays through an aching arm to find out if it is broken. To do so, we record how much of the emitted
    radiation travels through the arm and exits on the other side. The result is an X-ray image where different areas
    are shaded according to the amount of radiation that passed through. Bright areas indicate where the dense bones
    ‘swallowed’ more radiation. The surrounding tissue and fractures in the bone let more radiation through, so that the
    image is exposed to more X-rays and thus darker in those areas.

    A more detailed, three-dimensional image of the inside of a body is provided by computed tomography (CT). With this
    technique, many individual X-ray images are produced, which show adjacent cross-sections of the body and are
    combined to form a 3D image.

    In the hand luggage scanner at the airport, pieces of luggage are scanned with X-rays from different angles. Objects
    with different densities can be identified by how much radiation passes through them. Very dense materials (such as
    metal) absorb a lot of radiation; slightly less dense, mostly inorganic materials (such as glass) absorb less
    radiation; even less dense, mostly organic materials (such as food, plastics, liquids or explosives) absorb hardly
    any radiation.
