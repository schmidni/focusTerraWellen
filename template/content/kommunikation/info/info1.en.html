    When we speak, we produce sound waves. They are formed because our vocal chords cause the air to vibrate. With our
    mouths, we can shape the waves into recognisable sounds. When we put them together into words and sentences, we can
    communicate with others.

    When we talk with people near us, our conversa-tion is transmitted through the air. But we can also communicate
    through a medium other than air. This is demonstrated in a playful way by a tin can telephone, which carries the
    sound waves through a tautly stretched string: the sound of the speech emitted by one person hits the bottom of the
    can, which begins to vibrate and transmits the vibrations to the string. At the other end, the vibrations are
    transferred from the string back to the bottom of the other can and from there back into the air. The sound waves
    can now be heard as speech by the second person.
