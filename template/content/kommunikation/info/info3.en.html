    Ever more data is to be transmitted faster, farther and in ever better quality. This requires a well-developed
    network of connections – similar to a well-developed road network.
</p>
<p>
    Copper cables are increasingly being replaced by fibre optic cables, through which data can be transported much
    faster. In addition, there is hardly any loss of quality – even over long distances. In order to connect the whole
    world at high speed, the submarine fibre optic networks are being further expanded. Our mobile phone network is also
    connected to the fibre optic network – with the connection between mobile phone and antenna itself being wireless.

    Be it radio, mobile communications or the military, all fields have their own frequency ranges so as not to
    interfere with each other’s data transmission. Data volumes have become so large and users so numerous that the
    available frequencies are increasingly being used to capacity and several mobile phone users have to share the same
    frequency. As a result, phone calls are divided into data packets so that they can be transmitted in smaller chunks
    and thus almost simultaneously.
</p>
<p>
    With 5G, additional higher frequencies become available for mobile communications – like new lanes on a motorway.
    With these additional ‘lanes’, more data can be transmitted at the same time, so that the transmission of a certain
    amount of data is faster. Since the range of the higher frequencies is smaller, more antennas are needed for good
    network coverage. However, data is only transmitted to the users in ‘beams’ with exactly the required signal
    strength instead of being sent nonstop in all directions.
