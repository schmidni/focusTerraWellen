    Speech and music transmitted as sound waves have a rather short range. If we want to bridge greater distances, we
    have to convert the air oscillations of the sound waves into an electric signal. The voice of a radio presenter thus
    be-comes a sound curve. This curve is continuous or analogue, i.e. it has no interruptions or steps. In this form,
    the spoken word can be transmitted via copper cables.

    Nowadays, however, signals are usually trans-mitted in digital form. To do so, the sound curve is digitised, i.e.
    its waveform is sampled at regu-lar intervals and thus re-recorded. The resulting signal consists of individual
    values, reducing the amount of data. The values are translated into sequences of 0 and 1 – similar to Morse codes,
    where a sequence of short and long marks is as-signed to each letter of the alphabet.

    Both analogue and digital signals can be ‘pack-aged’ into electromagnetic waves in order to transmit them wirelessly
    or with light through fibre optic cables. The electromagnetic waves serve as carrier waves and reproduce the shape
    of the signal. In amplitude modulation (AM), the signal is reproduced by the amplitudes of the carrier wave, whereas
    in frequency modulation (FM), the signal is reproduced by the frequencies.
