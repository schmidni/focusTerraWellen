    Every day we make decisions that carry consequences. How do we make them? What information, standards and values do
    we use as guidance? What risks are we prepared to take for ourselves and others? Whether we know it or not, these
    questions also apply to our use of waves.

    In earthquake zones, the risk of damage can be reduced by ensuring buildings are earthquake-proof and adopting safe
    behaviour. Nevertheless, a certain degree of risk remains and we have to weigh up whether the advantages of living
    in that region outweigh the disadvantages. The production of nuclear power is climate-friendly. A nuclear accident,
    however, can have devastating consequences (e.g. due to leaking gamma radiation). In addition, a solution for safe
    disposal of radioactive waste has not yet been found.

    In our complex world, making responsible decisions is a big challenge. Often we have too much, too little or the
    wrong information, we do not understand it or it is contradictory. What is right for me may be wrong for nature and
    society. And some risks are only revealed after a longer period of time. We can counteract this uncertainty by
    handling new technologies with precaution. Good science and science communication provide important support to
    society and politics in their decision-making.
