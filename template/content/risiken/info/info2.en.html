    Technological advances open up new worlds for us. We can see and talk with people on the other side of the planet.
    We can search the seabed for mineral resources through enormous masses of water. But what is good for one may be bad
    for another.

    The sound waves used in deep-sea resource exploration disturb animals like whales and dolphins, who use sound waves
    to communicate, hunt and find mates. Artificial light sources let us move around safely at night, but they impair
    animalsâ€™ ability to navigate and, if used excessively and incorrectly, can also harm humans.

    The 5G mobile communication standard allows faster transmission of even larger amounts of data and offers great
    opportunities for innovation. On the other hand, citizens have concerns about radiation exposure. At the political
    level, there is discussion about what it means if the technology comes from another country. Is there a risk of
    foreign manipulation of central control channels with implications for energy supply, transport, the military or
    other critical infrastructure?

    Waves are also used as weapons. Nuclear explosions release large amounts of gamma radiation and huge pressure waves.
    Acoustic weapons can cause painfully loud sounds and thus hearing damage.
