    In order for the body to produce vitamin D, our skin needs the UV radiation contained in sunlight. However, if we
    stay in the sun for too long, our skin burns and ages faster. This is due to the energy that is carried in waves.

    X-rays can detect broken bones, but they have so much energy that they can ionise. This means that they can knock
    particles (electrons) out of atoms and thus be harmful to the tissue. This is why we should keep our bodiesâ€™
    exposure to X-rays to an absolute minimum. The visible light of a torch does not have this side effect; however, it
    also has too little energy to shine through the body.

    Waves of the same wavelength can also have different effects depending on their intensity. Sound waves enable us to
    communicate, but if they have too much energy, their noise can damage our hearing and lead to stress.
</p>
<p>
    Thus, when dealing with waves, we have to find a balance between harm and benefit.
