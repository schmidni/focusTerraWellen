    The stadium wave is created by successive movements. That is why we think we are seeing a spreading wave. As
    everyone in the stadium has a fixed place and knows exactly when to jump up, the propagation of the stadium wave is
    orderly and the wave movement is clearly visible.

    The swarm behaviour of some animals, the spread of a traffic jam by braking cars and the movement of centipede legs
    can also look like a spreading wave. In contrast to the stadium wave, however, these phenomena are not described
    with wave-related expressions in common language use.

    In comparison with physical waves, some similarities and differences stand out. While an atom cannot escape the
    transmission of a sound wave, a person in a stadium does not have to jump up just because everyone else does.
    However, most of the time they do. Studies have shown that people fall under the spell of the wave if initially at
    least 25 people jump up at the same time. The waves usually run clockwise at about 20 seats per second and a
    wavelength of about 15 seats. The reasons for this are unclear. What if we compared the direction of stadium waves
    in countries with right- and left-lane traffic? What if a stadium was filled with only left-handed people?
