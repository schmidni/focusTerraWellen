    Phenomena such as waves of fashion trends, waves of enthusiasm and flu waves take place within the network of
    society. Through their contacts, people can ‘infect’ each other with diseases, ideas and enthusiasm and thus
    contribute to a wave in society. How exactly this happens depends on the connections within the network. With the
    growth of cities, more and more people are coming together in smaller spaces; with technological progress, mobility
    and connectedness are increasing. Information and diseases can thus spread around the globe at an increasingly fast
    rate.

    What waves in society have in common with physical waves is the principle of spreading out. Instead of wave energy,
    however, it is viruses, ideas, emotions, etc. that propagate. Due to the complexity of societal interconnectedness,
    the possibilities for prediction are limited. We know, for example, that there will be a flu wave every year, but we
    know neither where nor how severe it will be.

    However, waves in society can be influenced. For example, we can decide whether or not to share and spread something
    on social media. Every individual is part of the societal network and can consciously – within the scope of his or
    her possibilities – contribute to the creation, strengthening or weakening of a wave. In this way, we all bear
    responsibility for the formation of opinions, values, norms and entire world views.
