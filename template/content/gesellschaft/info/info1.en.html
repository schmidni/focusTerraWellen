    Some terms for physical waves are part of our everyday language: water wave, sound wave, microwave. Other
    expressions, however, have little in common with physical waves: a wavy line, a waving flag or a permanent hair wave
    refer solely to the shape of a wave or to something that moves in a wave-like fashion. The things described do
    neither oscillate nor propagate.

    Other wave terms refer to events that arise periodically, just like a physical wave: heat waves, waves of refugees,
    waves of sympathy, flu waves and coronavirus waves. In addition, the choice of the term ‘wave’ can unconsciously or
    deliberately convey a feeling of being overwhelmed – comparable to a powerful water wave that can overrun us, sweep
    us away or knock us down. A hot spell becomes a heat wave and a movement of refugees becomes a wave of refugees. How
    would the perception of the COVID-19 pandemic change, for example, if it were not compared to a wave, but to a
    smouldering fire that breaks out occasionally in places?
