    In order to perceive more than what is naturally possible for us, we develop receivers such as satellites and
    seismometers as well as special cameras and microphones. With these, we measure tremors at active volcanoes, record
    infrasound of communicating whales or see the heat of inflamed joints in an elephant. This enables us to discover
    hidden worlds and thus develop a deeper understanding of natural processes as well as the animal and plant world.

    A new kind of perception was attained in 2015 when gravitational waves were recorded for the first time.
    Gravitational waves stretch and compress space and temporarily change the shape of the objects they encounter and
    the distance between them. The LISA (Laser Interferometer Space Antenna) mission led by ESA is a giant
    gravitational wave detector planned for 2034: three satellites connected to each other by laser beams over a
    distance of 2.5 million kilometres will measure even the smallest deformations in space. We hope that this will
    provide us with new insights into the formation of the universe, including the Big Bang.
