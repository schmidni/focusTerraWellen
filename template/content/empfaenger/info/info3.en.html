    In order to perceive more than what is naturally possible for us, we develop receivers such as sat-ellites and
    seismometers as well as special cam-eras and microphones. With these, we measure tremors at active volcanoes, record
    infrasound of communicating whales or see the heat of in-flamed joints in an elephant. This enables us to discover
    hidden worlds and thus develop a deeper understanding of natural processes as well as the animal and plant world.

    A new kind of perception was attained in 2015 when gravitational waves were recorded for the first time.
    Gravitational waves stretch and com-press space and temporarily change the shape of the objects they encounter and
    the distance be-tween them. The LISA (Laser Interferometer Space Antenna) mission led by ESA is a giant
    gravitational wave detector planned for 2034: three satellites connected to each other by laser beams over a
    distance of 2.5 million kilometres will measure even the smallest deformations in space. We hope that this will
    provide us with new insights into the formation of the universe, in-cluding the Big Bang.
