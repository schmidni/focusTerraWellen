    The light visible to us is made of electromagnetic waves in a certain range
    of wavelengths. We cannot see waves outside this range, such as short-wave
    UV or long-wave infrared radiation. Some animals, however, can.
</p>
<p>
    Honey bees see not only in the visible range, but also in the UV range.
    They are guided directly to nectar by structures in flowers that are only
    visi-ble in the UV range.
</p>
<p>
    Parrots and other bird species perceive the con-trast between the top and
    bottom of leaves more clearly thanks to UV vision. This probably enables
    them to navigate in dense forests. UV vision also plays a role in finding a
    mate: male birds’ feath-ers appear brighter when they have a strong im-mune
    system.
</p>
<p>
    Some cold-blooded animals have the ability to ‘see’ heat in the form of
    infrared radiation: cer-tain species of snakes have a special organ that
    enables them to detect warm-blooded prey even in the dark or when
    visibility is poor.
