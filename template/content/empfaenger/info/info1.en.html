    The light visible to us is made of electromagnetic waves in a certain range
    of wavelengths. We cannot see waves outside this range, such as shortwave
    UV or longwave infrared radiation. Some animals, however, can.
</p>
<p>
    Honey bees see not only in the visible range, but also in the UV range.
    They are guided directly to nectar by structures in flowers that are only
    visible in the UV range.
</p>
<p>
    Parrots and other bird species perceive the contrast between the top and
    bottom of leaves more clearly thanks to UV vision. This probably enables
    them to navigate in dense forests. UV vision also plays a role in finding a
    mate: male birds’ feathers appear brighter when they have a strong immune
    system.
</p>
<p>
    Some cold-blooded animals have the ability to ‘see’ heat in the form of
    infrared radiation: certain species of snakes have a special organ that
    enables them to detect warmblooded prey even in the dark or when
    visibility is poor.
