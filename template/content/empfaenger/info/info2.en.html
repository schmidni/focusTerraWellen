    We can only hear sound waves in a certain range of wavelengths. If particularly low sounds are loud enough, we can
    also feel them as vibrations. There are more sound waves below and above our hearing range: infrasound and
    ultrasound.
</p>
<p>
    Some animals communicate with infrasound, which travels long distances due to its long wavelength. Infrasound
    produced by elephants can reach the volume of a thunderstorm; that produced by whales can be as loud as a space
    shuttle taking off.
</p>
<p>
    Elephants ‘hum’ to produce low-frequency sounds which can be heard by fellow elephants several kilometres away. The
    humming also causes their whole body to vibrate, and this vibration is transmitted through the ground like the waves
    from an earthquake. Other elephants can feel these seismic waves through their trunks and the soles of their feet at
    a distance of more than 10 kilometres.
</p>
<p>
    Whales communicate with infrasound even across entire oceans. In addition, they emit clicking sounds in the
    shortwave ultrasound range, which they use for navigation and to catch prey – just like dolphins and bats. Some
    moths have developed an ear for ultrasound in order to escape from bats and can emit ultrasound themselves in
    order to confuse their predators.
