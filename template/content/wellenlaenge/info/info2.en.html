    The size and distance of an object determine which wavelength must be selected in order to examine it at the desired
    detail. Radar with microwaves is used for weather observations. A cloud radar detects cloud droplets using
    wavelengths in the millimetre range. Precipitation radar, on the other hand, uses wavelengths in the centimetre
    range to detect larger raindrops, hailstones and snowflakes. The smaller cloud droplets are missed by those waves,
    but larger objects such as flocks of birds can be misinterpreted as precipitation. Precipitation radar can scan the
    sky over greater distances than cloud radar because its longer wavelengths lose energy less quickly and therefore
    travel further.

    Radar can also be used to look into solid materials (ground-penetrating radar). Here, too, short wavelengths do not
    reach as deep, but they capture more details. Geologists looking for cavities at depths of several metres choose
    wavelengths in the metre range. Criminal investigators and palaeontologists need shorter wavelengths of 10 to 20
    centimetres to detect buried bones. If engineers are looking for material damage in a bridge at a depth of less than
    one metre, they use wavelengths of about five centimetres.
