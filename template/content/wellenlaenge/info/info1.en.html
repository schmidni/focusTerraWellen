    Using only our voice, we can make a glass vibrate so strongly that it shatters. To do this, we have to hit the right
    note – i.e. create a sound wave with the right wavelength and frequency. The frequency must correspond to the sound
    the glass makes when you tap it (resonance frequency).

    Buildings also have resonance frequencies. If a building is set into vibration at this frequency, it will vibrate at
    its maximum amplitude. The fact that a building’s resonance frequency depends mostly on its height becomes apparent
    when a strikingly large number of buildings of a certain height suffer severe damage during an earthquake. This
    occurs when the resonance frequency of the affected buildings corresponds to that of the ground, so that both
    vibrate at maximum amplitude. Accordingly, earthquake-proof construction takes into account the resonance frequency
    of the building as well as the nature of the ground beneath it.

    In humans, parts of the body can be set into vibration by a certain infrasound. This can cause an eerie feeling.
    Vibration of the eyeballs can cause a flickering in the corners of the eyes, which is sometimes interpreted as a
    supernatural phenomenon. That is why the frequency is also called the ‘frequency of fear’. Such infrasound can be
    generated by things like fans or wind blowing through old buildings.
