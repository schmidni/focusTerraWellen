    Waves convey information. To record them, we need measuring devices that match the respective wavelength. From
    space, the LISA mission should be able to detect gravitational waves with longer wavelengths than is possible with
    any of the observatories on Earth. To achieve this, the measuring apparatus will extend over millions of kilometres.
    LISA could thus allow for the observation of other gravitational wave sources such as the swallowing of a neutron
    star by a supermassive black hole.

    Selecting a suitable wavelength is also important in laboratory experiments. So far, experiments can only use
    wavelengths that fit into the lab. Hence, for example, earthquake experiments have to mimick the long wavelengths of
    earthquakes with much shorter wavelengths. Alternatively, experiments can be carried out virtually on a computer.
    However, neither in the laboratory nor virtually can reality truly be captured.

    A new approach combines the advantages of both the laboratory and the computer world: a virtual space is added onto
    a block of real rock in order for earthquake waves to fit into the experiment. The waves generated in the block must
    be able to travel into the virtual space undisturbed. That is, the waves must not ‘notice’ the boundary between the
    block and the virtual space, so all reflections etc. at the transition must be cancelled out. If this challenge is
    mastered, it will be possible in the future to bring the geological subsurface into the laboratory on a true scale.
    Then, researchers could investigate how well leaks in underground CO2 reservoirs can be detected with the help of
    seismic waves. This would make an important contribution to the safe storage of CO2 and thus its reduction in the
    atmosphere.
