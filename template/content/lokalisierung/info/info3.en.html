    A location can be determined with navigation systems such as GPS (Global Positioning System). This is how we know
    where we are on a map and how aircraft can follow their flight path.
</p>
<p>
    To determine our location, we receive signals from several satellites. These electromagnetic waves tell us the
    positions of the satellites from which they were transmitted and the exact time at which they were sent. Together
    with the time of reception, our GPS device determines how long each signal took to reach us. This time combined with
    the velocity of the waves – the speed of light – gives us the distances to the respective satel-lites. Combining
    this information from several satellites lets us determine our own location.

<p>
    The location determination is inaccurate if the signals are not travelling at the assumed speed of light. This
    occurs if the waves are slowed down along the way, e.g. by buildings or weather phe-nomena. In these cases, the
    speed of light used by the GPS device is too high and thus the calculated distance to the satellite is farther than
    reality.
