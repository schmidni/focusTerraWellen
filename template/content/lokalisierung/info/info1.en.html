    We can not only hear sounds, but also assess where they come from. We are particularly good at distinguishing
    whether a sound is coming from the left or the right. This is due to our ears sitting on either side of our head, so
    that the ear closer to the source of the noise receives the sound wave slightly earlier than the other.

    We can also estimate how far away a sound source is. To do this, our brain evaluates the vol-ume and the wavelength
    of the received sound waves: the farther away the source, the quieter the sound and the fewer short wavelengths
    (high-pitched sounds), as these lose energy quickly.

    Animals that use sound for navigation and hunt-ing prey have a much higher localisation accuracy than humans. They
    are much better at distin-guishing if a sound is coming from above or be-low and from ahead or behind. In bats, this
    is probably due to the shape of their auricles; in some owl species it is due to the asymmetric positioning of their
    ears.

    Dolphins are also very good at locating sounds, but they hear in a completely different way: the sound is
    transmitted from the water directly into their lower jaw bone. This is called bone conduc-tion, and its influence on
    the accuracy of localisa-tion is particularly interesting for medicine, be-cause bone conduction implants are being
    used to help humans with hearing impairments.
