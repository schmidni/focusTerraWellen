    Earthquake waves can be used to determine where an earthquake originated (its hypocentre). This is done using
    instruments that ‘hear’ earth-quake waves. The closer such a seismometer is to the hypocentre, the sooner the waves
    arrive. If we know their arrival times at different seismo-meters, we can roughly gauge in which direction the
    hypocentre lies.

    For an exact localisation, we have to determine the distance from each seismometer to the hypo-centre. To do this,
    we use the fact that different earthquake waves are generated at the same time but reach a seismometer at different
    times. Close to the hypocentre, the time difference be-tween the arrival of the P wave and the slower S wave is
    small; as the distance increases, it be-comes larger and larger. The difference in arrival times together with the
    wave velocities is then used to calculate the distance from the seismo-meter to the hypocentre. If we combine all
    these distances, we can determine where the hypocen-tre is located. The better we know where earth-quakes occur, the
    more precisely we can estimate how earthquake-prone a region is.

    The sources of gravitational waves in space can also be localised. The LISA mission plans to meas-ure gravitational
    waves using three satellites in space. Here, there are fewer interfering signals than on Earth and the measuring
    instruments can be placed extremely far away from each other. This should enable not only more precise
    meas-urements, but also more precise localisation than on Earth.
