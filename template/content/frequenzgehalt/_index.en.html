subTitle: "Using waves for identification thanks to their frequency content"

<h6>
    The frequencies at which a wave oscillates are like a fingerprint. Therefore, they can be used both to identify the
    object from which the wave was emitted and to find out what the wave has come into contact with â€“ for example with
    people, plants or gases.
