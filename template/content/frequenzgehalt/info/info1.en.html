    Our voice is unique and unmistakable. Its pitch is determined by the vibration of the vocal folds in the larynx. In
    a woman’s voice, they vibrate about twice as fast as in a man’s voice. Furthermore, the mouth, nose and throat
    change the sound waves formed in the larynx. In this way, a combination of frequencies creates the individual sound
    by which we can recognise a person.

    Technology can make use of this. For example, to unlock a mobile phone with speech, the owner’s voice must first be
    stored as an acoustic fingerprint. To do this, a voice sample is broken down into its frequency components. When the
    owner gives the spoken command to unlock, their voice is compared with the stored voice profile. Its main
    characteristics must be the same. However, a certain variability must be allowed; after all, you should be able to
    unlock your phone even when you have a cold or are sitting in a noisy restaurant.

    Visible light also has ‘fingerprints’. These are the different frequencies that we see as colours and the reason why
    we can distinguish the green traffic light from the red one. It also works outside the visible range: a person can
    be detected in the forest because their body, unlike the trees, emits heat – something we can measure with infrared
    cameras.
