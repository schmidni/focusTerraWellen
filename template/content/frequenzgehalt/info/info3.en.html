    When an ambulance approaches us, we hear its siren as a high-pitched sound. When it moves away from us, the pitch is
    lower. In both cases, the ambulance emitted the same sound. However, In the first case, the waves in front were
    ‘squeezed’ because of the movement so the frequency became higher. In the second case, the waves in the back were
    ‘stretched’ so the frequency became lower.

    Such frequency changes are typical for moving objects. They are also observed in the light of stars from distant
    galaxies: the starlight is redder when it reaches us. This red shift occurs because the galaxy is moving away from
    us, which ‘stretches’ the light. It therefore also serves as an indication that the universe is expanding.
