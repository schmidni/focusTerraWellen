    A red apple appears red because its skin reflects the red part of the sunlight and absorbs the other colours (i.e.
    it ‘swallows’ them). A green apple, on the other hand, reflects the green part of the sunlight. The colour of
    something we see therefore depends on how much it reflects or absorbs the different colour components (or
    frequencies).

    We make use of this when exploring the Earth with satellites, aeroplanes and drones. They measure which parts of the
    sunlight are reflected or absorbed by a surface. But it is not only the visible range that is of interest to us. In
    the infrared range in particular, we can distinguish between plant species and even determine their state of health.
    To do so, false-colour images are created by assigning ‘false’ colours to the frequency ranges. The colours are
    chosen in such a way that relevant differences become apparent – no matter how small they are. This often results in
    very colourful and thus informative images.

    Waves can also be used to measure the composition of the air. A device sends out waves with specially selected
    frequencies. These are reflected by the air particles and show a signal typical for each component. Thus, for
    example, exhaust gases released by factories can be detected and monitored.
