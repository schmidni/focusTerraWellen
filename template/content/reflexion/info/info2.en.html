    We cannot see into our body from the outside because we are not translucent. However, with suitable waves and their
    reflections, we can ‘feel’ inside. Medical professionals can send ultrasound waves into the body through the skin.
    These waves are reflected wherever the tissue changes. We can detect a baby in the mother’s womb be-cause its
    environment – the amniotic fluid – is liquid and the baby is not. Surveying the seafloor with sound waves (sonar)
    from a ship works in the same way: the sound waves sent through the water are reflected by the solid ground.

    Body scanners at airports scan passengers with electromagnetic waves. The waves penetrate clothing, but are
    reflected off the skin or, for ex-ample, a penknife left in a trouser pocket.

    The greater the difference between two materi-als, the stronger the reflection. This fact is also used for resource
    exploration: waves are gener-ated at the Earth’s surface and reflected by rock layers in the Earth. A boundary that
    is particular-ly well detectable with such seismic waves is the transition between rock and crude oil.

    Ground-penetrating radar allows us to map what lies underground in the same way. For example, its radio waves can be
    used to investigate ar-chaeological sites. Ground-penetrating radar can also be used from the air, for example to
    deter-mine the thickness of glacial ice. The data ob-tained help to document the effects of climate change.
