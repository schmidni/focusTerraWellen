    For air traffic control, it is important to know exactly where aircraft are located. That is why a flight radar
    scans the sky with radio waves. In autonomous driving, the car itself scans its sur-roundings. Here, lidar and radar
    are the main tools for navigation and distance measurement. The small wavelengths of lidar (mostly infrared lasers)
    can scan objects very precisely. They are used for all-round vision within a radius of up to 200 metres. In
    contrast, the longer and farther-reaching wavelengths of radar (mostly radio waves) are better suited to assess
    movements. Since lidar also reacts to weather phenomena like falling snowflakes, it is still difficult to make
    au-tonomous vehicles all-weather capable.

    And there are more challenges: How to process and interpret the huge amounts of data fast enough? How to make the
    best decisions when there is not enough data? Who is liable when an accident occurs? And how to prevent the car from
    getting hacked and controlled by others?
