    Many animals use reflected sound waves for nav-igation (echolocation). Bats, for example, repeat-edly emit short
    calls during their flight. These ultrasonic waves bounce off the objects in their environment. The returning echoes
    contain in-formation about the objects, including direction, distance, size, shape, material and movement. This
    allows bats to detect obstacles and prey.

    Daniel Kish has been blind since the age of one. He has learned to navigate with echolocation, similar to a bat: he
    makes clicking sounds with his tongue that reach many metres farther than his white cane. Each click gives him a
    brief ‘look’ at his surroundings. Repeated clicks create a de-tailed image in his head that even allows him to ride
    a bicycle. He also trains other visually-impaired people, giving them new possibilities to shape their lives.

    Research has shown that echolocation signals are processed in the part of the brain responsible for vision. Although
    Daniel’s perception of his sur-roundings is blurrier and less detailed than would be possible with eyesight, he can
    still see in his own way.
