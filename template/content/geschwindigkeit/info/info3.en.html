<p>
    If measuring stations register an earthquake, the information is automatically transmitted to a data centre via an
    electromagnetic wave. Since this signal travels much faster than earthquake waves, it can be used as a warning.
</p>
<p>
    Waves generated during an earthquake are rec-orded by seismometers. The arrival of the first waves is transmitted
    wirelessly or by fibre optic cable to a data centre. This signal is so fast that it overtakes even the fastest
    earthquake wave. Valuable seconds can thus be gained to warn people and, for example, to automatically slow down
    high-speed trains. The further away from the origin of a quake, the more time there is for an early warning.

<p>
    Early warnings can be improved by estimating more quickly how strong the shaking will be at a particular location.
    In addition, research focuses on making warnings easier to understand and speeding up simultaneous transmission to
    mil-lions of people.
