    A tsunami moves relatively slowly. Earthquake waves and electromagnetic signals from tsunami measuring stations can
    reach the coast more quickly so that people can be warned in time.
</p>
<p>
    When an earthquake occurs under the sea, a part of the sea floor can suddenly rise or fall. This sets the entire
    overlying water column in motion, generating a tsunami that spreads out in all directions. When its wave crests and
    troughs move over a pressure sensor on the sea floor, the amount of water above the sensor alternately increases and
    decreases. The sensor thus registers the typically long wavelengths of the tsunami. It transmits the signal via buoy
    and satellite to a data centre, from where a warning can be sent to the inhabitants on land.
</p>
<p>
    If a tsunami occurs near the coast, even electron-ic data transmission can take too long. In that case, natural
    warning signs such as a sensed earthquake or the receding of the sea can serve to alert us. However, all warnings
    are only useful if people receive them in time, understand them and know what to do â€“ regardless of where they are,
    what language they speak and whether they have a mobile phone or not.
