    First we see lightning, then we hear thunder. The lightning announces the storm and the thunder tells us how far
    away it is.
</p>
<p>
    The flash of lightning and the rumble of thunder originate in the same place at the same time, but they propagate at
    different velocities. The lightningâ€™s electromagnetic waves travel so fast that they reach us almost immediately.
    The much slower sound waves of the thunder reach us a little later.
</p>
<p>
    We count the seconds between lightning and thunder to find out how far away the storm is. Since sound waves take
    about three seconds to travel one kilometre in the air, we divide the lightsound delay by three and get the
    distance in kilometres. This information helps us to estimate if and when we have to get to safety.
