                <p>
                    When we sit in a little boat floating on the sea, we can feel how wave crests alternate with wave
                    troughs in the same place: the water surface moves up and down around a resting position. These
                    oscillations can be faster or slower; wave crests and troughs can be of different heights and depths
                    and their distance to each other can vary.

                    These characteristics are common to all physical waves and are described by their frequency,
                    amplitude and wavelength.

                <h2>Mechanical waves</h2>
                <p>
                    Sound waves, water waves and earthquake waves are mechanical waves. In order to propagate, they need
                    matter (e.g. air, water, the Earth), which they set into oscillation. The matter is temporarily
                    disturbed and then brought back into equilibrium by a restoring force, e.g. gravity in the case of
                    water waves. The disturbance spreads as a wave because each oscillating material particle transfers
                    its movement, i.e. its energy, to its neighbouring particles.
                </p>
                <h3>Surface waves</h3>
                <p>
                    Surface waves propagate along surfaces by setting them into oscillation. In the case of water waves,
                    the water surface gets disturbed. Water waves usually originate from wind and storms and involve
                    only the upper parts of the water column. Tsunamis, however, encompass the entire water column, all
                    the way to the bottom. – Surface waves also occur on the surface of the Earth. During an earthquake,
                    it is usually the surface waves that cause the greatest damage.

                <h2>Body waves</h2>
                <p>
                    When we speak, we produce sound waves that propagate or spread out in all directions. That is why
                    people around us can hear what we say. The sounds are transmitted as pressure waves, i.e. the air is
                    compressed and expanded in the direction of the sound’s propagation. The stronger this compression
                    and expansion, the larger the amplitude of the sound waves, i.e., the louder the sound. The faster
                    compression and expansion alternate, the higher the frequency, i.e., the higher the pitch. Our ears
                    can only hear sounds in a certain frequency range; lower frequencies are called infrasound and
                    higher frequencies are called ultrasound.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Pressure waves can propagate not only in air, but also in liquids and solids. That is why we can
                    hear in water and through walls. Pressure waves can also travel through solid ground. One such wave
                    is the fastest earthquake wave, the P wave (P for pressure or primary).
                </p>
                <p>
                    Whereas in air and water only pressure waves are possible, in solids you can also find shear waves.
                    In these waves, the particles oscillate perpendicularly to the direction of propagation. During an
                    earthquake, these shear waves are generated at the same time as the pressure waves and also
                    propagate in all directions. They are slower than the P waves and the second fastest earthquake
                    waves. They are called S waves (S for shear or secondary).

                <h2>Electromagnetic waves</h2>
                <p>
                    In electromagnetic waves such as light, it is electromagnetic fields that oscillate. These waves can
                    propagate through matter as well as through a vacuum. The oscillations are generated by accelerated
                    charged particles (protons, electrons) which disturb the surrounding electromagnetic fields. The
                    disturbance propagates in all directions as an electromagnetic wave oscillating perpendicularly to
                    the direction of propagation.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The higher the acceleration of the particle, the stronger the oscillation of the field and the
                    larger the amplitude of the wave. In the case of visible light, this means that it is brighter. The
                    faster the acceleration of the particle changes, the faster the oscillation of the field and the
                    higher the frequency of the wave. For visible light, this means it has a different colour. The
                    frequency range of electromagnetic waves is called the electromagnetic spectrum.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We ourselves are also constantly emitting electromagnetic waves in the form of heat (infrared
                    radiation). This is because charged particles vibrate in our bodies. The warmer something is, the
                    faster its particles vibrate and the higher the frequency of the electromagnetic waves that are
                    emitted. When something is so hot that part of the radiation produced is within the range visible to
                    us, it glows.
                </p>
                <h3>Radiation</h3>
                <p>
                    The term radiation is used for electromagnetic waves that have high frequency and therefore high
                    energy, such as X-rays and gamma rays. However, there is also particle radiation, which transports
                    energy in the form of particles (matter). This includes radioactive alpha and beta particles as well
                    as cosmic radiation. But no matter if it is waves or particles: radiation with more energy than
                    ultraviolet or UV radiation is ionising, i.e. it can knock electrons out of atoms and can therefore
                    be harmful to living beings.
                </p>
                <h3>
                    Wave-particle duality
                </h3>
                <p>
                    As with all waves, the propagation of electromagnetic waves transports energy. This means that the
                    energy is distributed evenly wherever the wave propagates. However, experiments have shown that the
                    energy of electromagnetic waves also behaves like particles and that it consists of individual
                    massless energy bundles (light particles or photons). This means that energy is not distributed
                    evenly, but can only be found where there are photons. In the end, both notions are valid at the
                    same time: energy is both distributed evenly and bundled in photons.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Similarly, material particles can behave like waves: in everyday life we make the experience that
                    objects, which are made up of particles, have clearly defined boundaries and therefore the same
                    applies to their energy. In experiments, however, we observe that the energy is also distributed
                    evenly – as in a wave.

                    Thus, waves are also particles and particles are also waves. This wave-particle duality forms the
                    basis of quantum physics, which succeeds in describing reality very accurately in mathematical
                    terms. However, this is where descriptive terms like ‘wave’ and ‘particle’ reach the limits of their
                    usefulness.

                    Gravitational waves squeeze and stretch the universe. This means that they cause space-time – i.e.
                    the three-dimensional space and time – to oscillate. In the process, objects such as planets are
                    temporarily deformed and the distances between them change. Gravitational waves are generated when
                    masses accelerate, for example when black holes collide: the faster the masses revolve around each
                    other and come closer together, the higher the frequency of the gravitational waves, i.e., the
                    faster the alternation between compression and expansion. The greater the masses, the larger the
                    amplitude of the waves and the stronger the deformation of space-time. Gravitational waves typically
                    have very long wavelengths. – We also generate gravitational waves with our movements. But these are
                    so tiny that they cannot be measured.
